# Environmental Metagenomics: Data processing and assembly (Metagenomics (Illumina HiSeq))

----

### Data processing and assembly based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) data generated via Illumina HiSeq

Workflow for processing raw whole genome sequencing (WGS) data (Illumina HiSeq) through to assembly.

The workflow outlined here includes:

- WGS Illumina HiSeq data qc, trimming, and filtering
- Assembly

This workflow was developed within the group of Associate Professor Kim Handley (University of Auckland) under the Environmental Metagenomics branch of Genomics Aotearoa. 

It is intended as companion document to:

* downstream processing workflows including: Prokaryote_metagenomics_Binning; Prokaryote_genomics; Viromics_WGS
* the metagenomics summer school materials 

Scripts and software usage are directed towards researchers based in Aotearoa New Zealand, and who have access to the *New Zealand eScience Infrastructure* (NeSI). Installation and maintainance of the relevant software is not discussed here, and we are not resourced to support adapting this workflow to other settings. However, for users who have appropriate computing resources available with the necessary software installed, this information should be entirely transferrable.
