    "\n",
    "The examples below are based on sequencing of **12 isolates**, multiplexed during ONT library prep (each tagged with a unique barcode). Long-read sequencing data was generated on an Oxford Nanopore GridION, with basecalling based on high accuracy basecalling (HAC; Q9). In this example, basecalling was done in real time during sequencing. However, you can also opt to perform basecalling separately on the raw data after the fact. In our tests, comparable (generally identical) steps were also appropriate for processing data based on super accuracy basecalling model (SUP; Q10). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Using HAC data can increase coverage (compared with SUP data), but at the expense of a lower quality threshold for individual reads. Coverage depth can be an important factor in the completeness and accuracy of genome assemblies downstream, and so can be important to consider when choosing between HAC and SUP data.\n"
